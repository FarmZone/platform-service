        <h1><b>About Us</b></h1>
<p><span>A3agri is an initiative by a consortium of like-minded professionals who are passionate about
bringing the positive impact in the lives of farmers. The idea is the culmination of years of experience in
the agricultural sector with a vision and mission of creating a unique and sustainable solution for the
entire agriculture-ecosystem at large through a simple mobile interface.</span></p>
<p><span>We know that there has been an upswing in the smartphone usage in the last few years and everyone is
hopeful about the agriculture sector. It is the right time to introduce the effective connectivity among all
the stakeholders i.e. the Farmers, dealers and the manufacturer via a mobile application.</span></p>
<p><span>We are an e-commerce company connecting Agriculture equipment Manufacturers directly to the end
users ie farmers (who Buys from dealer) ie A “B2M-Buyer to manufacturer” technology platform.</span></p>
<p><span>Agriculture per say is a hyper local activity with the result the awareness and the exposure is very
limited. Most of the agriculture equipment manufacturers will have a distribution channel which will
allow them to interact, promote and sell the product to the end user through the network but the ability
to interact directly in order to have more insight about the product performance or after-market
support somehow is missing. This results into a very low repeat buyer’s ratio.</span></p>
<p><span>The idea is to establish direct link between the users and the manufacturer, bring visibility amongst all
the key stakeholders and allow effective communication to flow between all the levels through the
technology platform. With the result the unmet needs like availability of spare parts, after market
support or complaint resolution can be resolved as fast as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>A3agri aims to transform Agri-Business for farmers in rural India. We intend to do this by keeping
the farmer as the focal point of everything we do. We are building a technology platform that provides
real time solutions to farmers for all their agri needs. Farmers can simply access and order for spare
parts, new product or complaint resolution just over a click from the mobile app and the same shall be
delivered right to their doorsteps.</span></p>
